# ASCII-REPLIT-
Convert Images and Texts Into ASCII Art.  # Packages Used: - PIL for image to ASCII Art - pyfiglet for text to ASCII Art  # Update: - Added Text To ASCII Art Generator - Custom Font option in Text to ASCII Generator - Added Unicode char style in image to ASCII Generator  # Helpers: - @codeitfast - @DariaScott  # Important So many users are getting this error --- `local variable 'image' referenced before assignment`  # Why is this happening? There are **2 reasons** behind this: - The Image URL is not accessible - The Image type is not supported (svg, gifs, etc.)   --- _Note: Images are **not** saved anywhere_
